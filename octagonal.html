	<p class="spesification">Octagonal emporium is another contemporary brand which was eventually 
	swallowed up by HMV/Victor. Sometimes known as ‘Hornless’ gramophones, 
	these were actually some of the first internal horn machines and this is 
	a model 1 which was shown in their 1919/1920 model year catalogue. It has a 
	manual brake, 10” turntable and a single spring motor (predictably the model 
	2 had a 12” turntable and a double spring motor!) I got this machine ridiculously
	cheaply on eBay but it was in awful condition. It had a later Decca soundbox on it
	and the wrong winding handle. The handle arm was so long, in fact, that you had to
	lift the unit up to wind it otherwise the handle would hit the table. It was old 
	and dirty and needed a full restoration; the motor was completely stripped down and 
	cleaned, re-assembled, adjusted and lubricated.</p>

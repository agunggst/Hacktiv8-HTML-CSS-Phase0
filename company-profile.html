        Why us?
      </h1>

      <h2>
        Satisfaction Guaranteed
      </h2>
      <p>
        Your satisfaction is our number one goal. If you’re not happy, we’re not happy! You can return any purchase within 7 days for a full refund* or within 30 days to exchange. If a product requires service three times during the first year, we’ll replace it free of charge. Having over 40 years of return customers is your assurance that you’ll be thrilled with our products and services.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Own The Best
      </h2>
      <p>
        We’re very careful about the products we offer and we want them to represent the best value in every price range. We have high standards for quality, performance, and value and are proud to offer products that we would want in our own homes. We stay on top of changes in technology and what’s new in the marketplace to make sure we have the best value products in every price range.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Lowest Price!
      </h2>
      <p>
        You won’t pay more to shop at Gramophone. We’re in a highly competitive marketplace and have joined with companies like ours throughout the United States to pool our buying power to make sure that you will not pay more for the same products. Getting proper service and advice on the best available equipment shouldn’t have to cost more. If any local authorized dealer advertises the same product at a lower price within thirty (30) days of your date of purchase, we will gladly refund the difference.
